# 🧠 Lab 07 - Computer Vision with OpenCV and YOLOv8

Welcome to **Lab 07** of the SP25 Artificial Intelligence Course. This lab provides a deep dive into **computer vision**, combining traditional image processing techniques with deep learning-powered object detection using **YOLOv8**. You'll explore how to work with images and video using OpenCV and learn how to detect real-world objects using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model, leveraging Roboflow for dataset management and training.

## 📚 Lab Overview

### 🔹 Part 1: Image Processing with OpenCV

In this part, students will:

- Read and write images.
- Display images using OpenCV.
- Draw shapes (rectangle, circle, line) and annotate images with text.
- Capture live video from a webcam.
- Convert images to grayscale, RGB, or HSV formats.
- Detect edges using Canny Edge Detection.
- (Bonus) Use Haar Cascades for face detection.

📘 **Key Notebook**: `open_cv_lab.ipynb`

### 🔹 Part 2: Custom Object Detection using YOLOv8

In this part, students will:

- Understand the architecture and working of the YOLOv8 model.
- Use [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) to create, annotate, and manage datasets.
- Train the YOLOv8 model in Google Colab using Ultralytics.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like mAP, Precision, and Recall.
- Perform inference on new images or live video.

📘 **Key Notebook**: `YOLOv8.ipynb`

## 🛠️ Requirements

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install ultralytics
pip install roboflow
```

You also need:
- A **Google Colab** account
- A **Roboflow** account (free version is sufficient)
- Labeled dataset (custom or from Roboflow's public dataset hub)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jamil226/SP25-AI.git
cd SP25-AI/Lab-07 - Computer Vision
